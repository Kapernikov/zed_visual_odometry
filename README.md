## 1. STEREOLABS ZED Stereo Camera
![zed.jpg](media/zed.jpg)
The ZED Stereo Camera developed by [STEREOLABS](https://www.stereolabs.com/) is
a camera system based on the concept of human stereovision. In addition to
viewing RGB, stereovision also allows the perception of depth. Advanced computer
vision and geometric techniques can use depth perception to accurately estimate
the 6DoF pose (x,y,z,roll,pitch,yaw) of the camera and therefore also the pose
of the system it is mounted on. At the same time, it provides high quality 3D
point clouds, which can be used to build 3D metric maps of the environment.

The camera can generate VGA (100Hz) to 2K (15Hz) stereo image streams. The 12cm
baseline (distance between left and right camera) results in a 0.5-20m range of
depth perception, about four times higher than the widespread Kinect Depth
sensors. Furthermore, one of the most striking advantages of this stereo camera
technology is that it can also be used outdoors, where IR interference from
sunlight renders structured-light-type sensors like the Kinect inoperable. As a
result, this system is ideal for robots or machines that operate indoors,
outdoors or both. It can also be used for many different applications, ranging
from pose estimation, mapping, autonomous navigation to object detection and
tracking and many more.

## 2. Visual Odometry and SLAM
Visual Odometry is the process of estimating the motion of a camera in real-time
using successive images. There are many different camera setups/configurations
that can be used for visual odometry, including monocular, stereo,
omni-directional, and RGB-D cameras. The cheapest solution of course is
monocular visual odometry. However, with this approach it is not possible to
estimate scale. This can be solved by adding a camera, which results in a stereo
camera setup.

The following approach to stereo visual odometry consists of five steps.
Firstly, the stereo image pair is rectified, which undistorts and projects the
images onto a common plane. Feature detection extracts local features from the
two images of the stereo pair. Then, Stereo Matching tries to find feature
correspondences between the two image feature sets. Since the images are
rectified, the search is done only on the same image row. Usually the search is
further restricted to a range of pixels on the same line. There is also an
extra step of feature matching, but this time between two successive frames
in time. Finally, an algorithm such as RANSAC is used for every stereo pair to
incrementally estimate the camera pose. This is done by using the features that
were tracked in the previous step and by rejecting outlier feature matches.

| Stereo Rectification | Stereo Feature Matches | Temporal Feature Matches |
|:--------------------:|:----------------------:|:------------------------:|

Due to the incremental nature of this particular type of pose estimation, error
accumulation is inevitable. The longer the system operates, the bigger the error
accumulation will be. Therefore, we need to improve the visual odometry
algorithm and find a way to counteract that drift and provide a more robust pose
estimate. This can be done with loop closure detection. This technique offers a
way to store a dictionary of visual features from visited areas in a
bag-of-words approach. This dictionary is then used to detect matches between
current frame feature sets and past ones. If a match is found, a transform is
calculated and it is used to optimize the trajectory graph and to minimize the
accumulated error.

| Loop Closure Detection and Map Graph Optimization |

Visual Odometry algorithms can be integrated into a 3D Visual SLAM system, which
makes it possible to map an environment and localize objects in that environment
at the same time. RTAB-Map is such a 3D Visual SLAM algorithm. It consists of a
graph-based SLAM approach that uses external odometry as input, such as stereo
visual odometry, and generates a trajectory graph with nodes and links
corresponding to past camera poses and transforms between them respectively.
Each node also contains a point cloud, which is used in the generation of the 3D
metric map of the environment. Since RTAB-Map stores all the information in a
highly efficient short-term and long-term memory approach, it allows for
large-scale lengthy mapping sessions. Loop closure detection also enables the
recognition of revisited areas and the refinement of its graph and subsequent
map through graph optimization.

## 5. Recording and Playback
Assuming you have already installed RTAB-Map from the previous section, in this
section you can learn how to record a session with ZED and playing it back for
experimentation with different parameters of RTAB-Map.

First of all, clone and build our repository with the required launchers as
shown below:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Kapernikov/zed_visual_odometry.git
$ catkin build zed_visual_odometry
$ source ~/.bashrc # or ~/.zshrc
```

Then connect a ZED Stereo Camera on your computer and launch the recorder:
```bash
$ roslaunch zed_visual_odometry zed_rtabmap_db_recorder.launch
```
Do your session with the camera and when you are done, simply close the recorder
(ctrl+c). The database of the session you recorded will be stored in
~/.ros/output.db. You can now launch the playback node along with rtabmap by
calling the corresponding launcher as follows:
```bash
$ roslaunch zed_visual_odometry zed_rtabmap_db_playback.launch
```
If you are not satisfied with the results, play around with the parameters of
the configuration file located inside our repository
(zed_visual_odometry/config/rtabmap.ini) and rerun the playback launcher.
